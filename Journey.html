    <p>
        In our last session, the adventuring party continued through the dungeon below the Villa of the Vanthampur’s,
        Duke Vanthampur being the pseudo leader of the Council of Baldur’s Gate in the absence of Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard,
        who left the City in order to facilitate a peace between Baldur’s Gate and Elturel who have been longtime rivals.
        The Duke was slain by the group, along with any possible way that you know of to show evidence of
        their corruption (though there is a lot of things to go through) and what they have been doing besides a strange artifact,
        a puzzle box, though you do not know yet how it works or what the box holds inside.<br />
        <br />
        It has been discovered though that this may have all been a plot by the Vanthampur’s to wrestle control of Baldur’s Gate.
        It has also been brought to their attention that while the Grand Duke was in Elturel, the Holy Capital of the land has fallen,
        and while it fell, the Leader of Elturel, Thavius Kreeg made his way to Baldur’s Gate, he says that he was brought to the City
        to do just what the Grand Duke was sent to do in Elturel.<br />
        <br />
        Now with the fall of The Holy City of Elturel, little is know other than information given by refugees that the city up and
        vanished, others sighting a flash before it vanished and that is all you have to go by.<br />
        <br />
        The Vanthampur’s sought to utilize the power of an object known as “The Shield of the Hidden Lord”, though it is not known
        how they would do this, the shield has stated it has resisted their attempts to take and use it’s power.<br />
        <br />
        It was after this that party ran into a new face, a gigantic Lizardfolk named Luskaor, who was imprisoned here below the
        Villa after attempting to infiltrate the Vanthampur estate, he was seeking the very puzzle box that once he is out of the
        prison and put on his gear, he looked up and saw Daki with the puzzle box and became very excited. He explained that he
        was searching for this on the behest of the leading expert in the 9 Hells in all of the realms, Sylvira Savakis who resides
        in Candlekeep, the hub of all knowledge in the realms. Sylvira is seeking the puzzle box to study but also to find out the
        truth about the leader of Elturel, whom she believes was working against the City for quite some time and may be the reason
        for the downfall of the city.<br />
        <br />
        Once out of the dungeon below, and out of the Villa itself, the party seeks a place to lay low and gather what information
        they can before reporting back to the Flaming Fist. After bringing Aurayauna back to Blade and Stars Inn. It is decided that
        the party will split up, 3 will go to Elturel and discover what has happened and help in any way they can. The others must
        decide where best to go to solve the mystery of the now missing City.<br />
        <br />
        The party then decided to grab all the evidence they had and present it to Captain Zodge and explain what happened. They were
        then met by Commander Portyr who spoke about her knowledge of many of the goings on in Baldur’s Gate but obviously not all.
        It was made aware that while people thought members of the council corrupt, it seems not all were. With Grand Duke Ulder
        Ravengard still missing, Commander Portyr will now control the Flaming Fist and will help to have a good and just government.
        Commander Portyr offered the group an additional 500g each and a Riding Horse for each of them for their service to the town.
        The group now heads South to Candlekeep to discover the secrets of the Infernal Puzzle box.<br />
